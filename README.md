# AI Pro Bono Studio

Agent-driven pipeline to evaluate, validate, build, and launch startup ideas on shared infrastructure.

## Core flow

1. **Economic Judge Agent**
   - Checks whether the idea is financially viable.
   - Output: go/no-go + viability score.

2. **Market & Competitor Agent**
   - Maps competitors, demand, and market positioning.
   - Output: market brief + opportunity gaps.

3. **Product Service Agent**
   - Defines MVP scope, user flow, and success metrics.
   - Output: product spec and 2-4 week roadmap.

4. **Engineering Manager Agent**
   - Orchestrates specialist build agents (frontend/backend/data/devops).
   - Output: deployed MVP on shared infra.

## Business model (draft)

- Development is fully covered by us (time + infrastructure).
- Revenue share model (default candidate): **30%** of revenue.
- For higher-risk or higher-capex projects: consider **40%-50%** or tiered share by milestones.
